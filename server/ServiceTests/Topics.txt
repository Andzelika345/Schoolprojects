Real dependencies
- Pros / cons for testing

Manual stubbing
- Why interfaces are important: Relying on an abstraction can provide mock implementation
    - Interfaces also don't require parameters
        - Circumvents the problem with parameterless constructors

NSubstitute
- Can be used for third party libraries: Only circumventable approach is to make wrappers to the third party library
Static invocations:
- Substitute.For<T>
- Arg.Any<T> for passing in params
Extension Methods:
- Returns()
